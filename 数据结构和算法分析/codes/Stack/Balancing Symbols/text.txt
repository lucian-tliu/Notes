This is a sample text for testing balancing symbols.
The function call looks like this: compute(a, b[2], {x: (y + z), msg: "hello(world)"}).
Sometimes people write things like: [ { ( ) } ] and expect them to match correctly.

Here is a JSON-like example:
{
    "name": "Alice",
    "skills": ["C", "Python", "Rust"],
    "profile": {
        "bio": "She said, \"I love (systems) programming!\" and smiled.",
        "active": true
    }
}

And here is a tricky line:
print("This (should) not break [anything] inside \"quotes\".");
